	            <p>Edward Gillham, son of Alexander and Cassandra Gillham, rulers of the Crimson District of Falrik, was just declared a paladin of the Silver Flame church but his parents were not confident about his skills and wanted him to train more. They hired a soldier from the Prime Guardians, the military of the city, named Beljahmr, a half-orc barbarian and a city town guard.</p>
	            <p>They trained in the courtyard of the Gillham mansion and Edward won by bashing Beljahmr with his shield. Knocking him down and went unconscious. Beljahmr was then aided and took rest at the mansion. Edward then earned the respect of Beljahmr because he has proven himself as a true warrior.</p>
	            <p>The Gillham family had dinner together with Beljahmr. While having dinner, they talked about the problem in the city, specifically the problem within the mines, which is the main source of income of the city. The mines were overrun by kobolds and they wanted to clear the mines from the kobolds. Alexander wishes Edward to join the operation in dispatching the monsters tomorrow morning and asked Beljahmr's permission. Beljahmr accepted and then they all slept for the night.</p>
	            <p>Dawn has arrived and the operation was about to begin, Edward and Beljahmr went to the mines. Upon arriving in the mines, they were joined with 11 other guards and their captain, Aurreus. A small gnome suddenly arrived named Jorhan and was also part of the operation. The plan was to split the group into 3 persons and each group will carry a bomb that will spread toxic gas when exploded. The group will split up, one group for each tunnel in the mine. One group consisted of Edward, Beljahmr and Jorhan and Jorhan was tasked in throwing the bomb.</p>
	            <p>When everyone was ready, captain Aurreus gave the signal to throw the bomb. Jorhan threw the bomb, but it was too high that the bomb hit the ceiling, causing it to bounce back to the party. The explosion harmed the party and was heard by the kobolds, 6 appeared and attacked the party. During the battle, the kobolds didn't recognize the toxic gas scattered in the area and was affected. The party avoided the gas and it gave them a huge advantage in the battle, Edward and Beljahmr slicing the monsters in half while Jorhan unleashed furies of fists to them. But party was still outnumbered as 4 more appeared behind them and Beljahmr went unconscious as the kobolds surrounded him. When Edward saw Beljahmr unconscious, his holy symbol glowed, granting him healing powers as a paladin. Beljahmr was healed and they then defeated the rest of the enemies.</p>
	            <p>Everyone went outside and only 7 guards were left with Aurreus and Blejahmr's group. They were all exhausted and did not expected such many kobolds occupied in the mines.

                After clearing the kobolds in the mines, Edward and Beljahmr noticed Jorhan disappeared, but Beljahmr saw him leaving the group. He approached Jorhan and asked why he left, with an unexpected fist but Jorhan managed to avoid it. Jorhan told them that he was hired to cooperate in the operation within the mines and he was about to get the reward. But since he was part of their group, he decided to share the gold. They followed Jorhan to the contractor and arrived in the Hunter’s Guild. The contractor was surprised that Jorhan arrived with a party, but they still got the reward and Jorhan left.</p>
              <p>
                Before they could go out, they noticed two tieflings suddenly arrived carrying three heads of a hawk with crimson feathers. The contractor took the heads and gave them a small bag of coins . The party went out and saw a notice board nearby and someone recently posted a message on the board and left. Edward checked the post, but the tiefling, Kevtumal, who they just saw rushed toward the board. The post tells about a bounty for an humanoid-sized insect covered in thick red armor that eats metal, known as a rust monster, and has recently damaged his masonry shop. Kevtumal got took the post and he went to the requester together with his fellow tiefling, "Equity". Edward and Beljahmr followed them to the masonry, located northern center of the city, but found them already at the masonry negotiating with a dwarf who seemed to be the requester, about the bounty. The bounty was 50 gold pieces in exchange with the head of the metal eating insect. Edward and Beljahmr approached them and requested that they will join the hunt, but only for the experience and the tieflings will have the gold full. They both agreed and started to hunt the monster.</p>
              <p>
                The monster was last seen at midnight, eating the metal parts that were just delivered to the dwarf for his products, just outside the shop and when he tried to fight the monster, it was already gone and most of the delivered goods were eaten and turned into rust. The four characters started to investigate outside the shop and they noticed tiny footprints heading west and followed it. The footprints lead them to a tavern and it seemed it leads behind it. But Beljahmr saw inside the tavern a human drinking from a large container and everyone was cheering "CHUG! CHUG! CHUG!". It seemed a drinking contest was held and Beljahmr got excited and also cheered for the human from outside. Edward also saw it and cheered for the human as well. While the two were distracted, Kevtumal suddenly disappeared and only Equity was left. After the contest was finished, they noticed that Kevtumal was nowhere to be found.</p>
                <p>
                Equity told them that Kevtumal went ahead and they chat for some minutes. After a while, the three they went after Kevtumal and found a hole, 10 ft. in diameter and 10 f.t deep. They went down carefully and found a dark cave. Equity used dancing lights spell to have light in the area and they all entered. They followed Equity and found Kevtumal, who was already in battle with the rust monster. The three helped Kevtumal and they defeated monster with Equity's rapier slashing it with it's sign "EQ" left on its body, with their weapons and armors rusted by the monster's body. After the battle, the tieflings saw something in the area and grabbed it then went out quickly. Beljahmr was not sure of their intention, but he beheaded the monster for proof of its bounty and went out with Edward.
                When they got out of the cave, they found the tieflings waiting for them. Kevtumal negotiated with them in exchange for the head, they will now give their trust to each other. Beljahmr hesitated at first but Edward agreed with Kevtumal and exchanged with the head.

              After the party agreed on each other's terms, 4 red-hooded humanoid creatures suddenly appeared before them. One of them came closer and asked for the object held by Equity. He then looked at the rest of the party and uttered: "Oh look! A Gillham is with you!? Hahaha! What a lovely surprise!" Edward was shocked and replied, "What do you mean?". The man chuckled and said, "You mean you're parents haven't told you? Tsk. Tsk. Such a shameful parenting."
          </p>
              <p>Edward was still in disarray and still could not understand. At the same time, the other hooded creatures began spreading in a semi-circle formation centered on the party. Kevtumal immediately cast a spell and started a fight. </p>
              <p>During the battle, Beljahmr was able to deal a lethal blow to one of them in a single slash, but the one who spoke to Edward took out a red glowing stone. It glows bright red then flickers slowly as of a heartbeat. He went to his recently killed ally then crushed the stone, magic began streaming from the stone and into the dead body, the wounds began to close and suddenly, the dead creature awaken as if it was only a sleep. Another one of them who was heavily injured took another one out and break it, regenerating his wounds.Two more of them jumped from the roof the the tavern beside, joined the onslaught and was able to knockout Kev. The same hooded figure said "We only ask for the stones and for you to drop your weapons."</p>
              <p>The party were badly injured and had not much strength left, so they followed and dropped their weapons. He asked for Equity to come close and give them what they want. Equity pulled out a blue glowing stone from his pocket and gave it to him. He then poured small amount of blood from his wound stone and it became dull red. He crushed it and his wounds were healed. "Where are the other stones?" He asked. Equity replied, "That's all we have and nothing more."</p>
              <p>"Search them!" The man shouted. They searched the party for more stones but failed to find more. He became furious and ordered to execute them all. Suddenly, a fireball struck two of the enemies dead. Far away in the corner, Caerys, a blue dragonborn was standing in the middle of three guards. Belj knew one of the guards and his name is Victor. The leader panicked then ran away leaving three of his followers behind and was arrested.</p>
              <p>Edward told Caerys what happened and she suggested to continue the conversation at the barracks. The party took rest, patched up their injuries and talked about the stone with Victor. Caerys calmly told the party, "Those red hooded figures that you've encountered were searching for a precious artifact called a Star Stone." The mood in the room suddenly became serious. She continued "These stones are very powerful and helps a mage to achieve power beyond his capabilities. But these are also perilous as harnessing such power required careful concentration or suffer its might."</p>
              <p>"Which is why these magic items are banned from usage in the city." Victor interrupted. "I suggest you all stay away from this group. Your next encounter with them might be your last."</p>
              <p>Caerys added, "That is all the info we can give to you. I suggest you seek a high elf, located in the city library, named Tina Fey. We've heard she knows more about these stones and should be able to help you all. Here, use it wisely" Then Caerys gave the party three potions which Edward, Beljahmr, and Equity is holding.</p>
              <p>"We should interrogate the prisoners first." Edward suggested. Kevtumal replied, "You guys go, I'll collect first our bounty." He then suddenly left. The party went to the prison cell, which was below the barracks. On the left was the half-elf male that didn’t respond to any questions. On the right is a human of young age and a matured human girl.</p>
              <p>Edward talked to the half-elf but it didn’t respond. He then talked to the girl and she said "We want to dethrone the three lords of this city!" and the girl spat at Edward. Equity noticed that the human kid was scared, so he went to him and asked, "Why are you afraid?". The kid replied with heavy breathing "Let me go, I don't want to be here." </p>
              <p>Edward asked "What's in it for us?" </p>
              <p>"I can give you our precious Blood Stones! Just let me out!" The kid told them with a furious tantrum.</p>
              <p>The party asked for Caerys advice but she said that she doesn’t trust these prisoners. Then Kev arrived and he tried to interrogate telepathically to the kid but it only frightened the kid. He tried the same to the half-elf. He was surprised answered “So you're also a follower of him?” All was shocked because of the response and at the same time, the communication was broadcast to all.</p>
              <p>"A follower to him also is a welcomed ally, and thus worthy of my knowledge. Our goal is to gather Star Stones and convert them into Blood Stones. With enough Blood Stones, it can revive our true ruler who will lead us to glory!"</p>
              <p>Kev asked, "Who is your leader and where is your hiding place?" </p>
              <p>"This I do not know. I have just been recently recruited and when we held a meeting at the mines, our faces were covered and it was too dark." The half-elf replied.
