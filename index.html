	            <p>Edward Gillham, son of Alexander and Cassandra Gillham, rulers of the Crimson District of Falrik, was just declared a paladin of the Silver Flame church but his parents were not confident about his skills and wanted him to train more. They hired a soldier from the Prime Guardians, the military of the city, named Beljahmr, a half-orc barbarian and a city town guard.</p>
	            <p>They trained in the courtyard of the Gillham mansion and Edward won by bashing Beljahmr with his shield. Knocking him down and went unconscious. Beljahmr was then aided and took rest at the mansion. Edward then earned the respect of Beljahmr because he has proven himself as a true warrior.</p>
	            <p>The Gillham family had dinner together with Beljahmr. While having dinner, they talked about the problem in the city, specifically the problem within the mines, which is the main source of income of the city. The mines were overrun by kobolds and they wanted to clear the mines from the kobolds. Alexander wishes Edward to join the operation in dispatching the monsters tomorrow morning and asked Beljahmr's permission. Beljahmr accepted and then they all slept for the night.</p>
	            <p>Dawn has arrived and the operation was about to begin, Edward and Beljahmr went to the mines. Upon arriving in the mines, they were joined with 11 other guards and their captain, Aurreus. A small gnome suddenly arrived named Jorhan and was also part of the operation. The plan was to split the group into 3 persons and each group will carry a bomb that will spread toxic gas when exploded. The group will split up, one group for each tunnel in the mine. One group consisted of Edward, Beljahmr and Jorhan and Jorhan was tasked in throwing the bomb.</p>
	            <p>When everyone was ready, captain Aurreus gave the signal to throw the bomb. Jorhan threw the bomb, but it was too high that the bomb hit the ceiling, causing it to bounce back to the party. The explosion harmed the party and was heard by the kobolds, 6 appeared and attacked the party. During the battle, the kobolds didn't recognize the toxic gas scattered in the area and was affected. The party avoided the gas and it gave them a huge advantage in the battle, Edward and Beljahmr slicing the monsters in half while Jorhan unleashed furies of fists to them. But party was still outnumbered as 4 more appeared behind them and Beljahmr went unconscious as the kobolds surrounded him. When Edward saw Beljahmr unconscious, his holy symbol glowed, granting him healing powers as a paladin. Beljahmr was healed and they then defeated the rest of the enemies.</p>
	            <p>Everyone went outside and only 7 guards were left with Aurreus and Blejahmr's group. They were all exhausted and did not expected such many kobolds occupied in the mines.

                After clearing the kobolds in the mines, Edward and Beljahmr noticed Jorhan disappeared, but Beljahmr saw him leaving the group. He approached Jorhan and asked why he left, with an unexpected fist but Jorhan managed to avoid it. Jorhan told them that he was hired to cooperate in the operation within the mines and he was about to get the reward. But since he was part of their group, he decided to share the gold. They followed Jorhan to the contractor and arrived in the Hunterâ€™s Guild. The contractor was surprised that Jorhan arrived with a party, but they still got the reward and Jorhan left.</p>
            <p>
                Before they could go out, they noticed two tieflings suddenly arrived carrying three heads of a hawk with crimson feathers. The contractor took the heads and gave them a small bag of coins . The party went out and saw a notice board nearby and someone recently posted a message on the board and left. Edward checked the post, but the tiefling, Kevtumal, who they just saw rushed toward the board. The post tells about a bounty for an humanoid-sized insect covered in thick red armor that eats metal, known as a rust monster, and has recently damaged his masonry shop. Kevtumal got took the post and he went to the requester together with his fellow tiefling, "Equity". Edward and Beljahmr followed them to the masonry, located northern center of the city, but found them already at the masonry negotiating with a dwarf who seemed to be the requester, about the bounty. The bounty was 50 gold pieces in exchange with the head of the metal eating insect. Edward and Beljahmr approached them and requested that they will join the hunt, but only for the experience and the tieflings will have the gold full. They both agreed and started to hunt the monster.</p>
            <p>
                The monster was last seen at midnight, eating the metal parts that were just delivered to the dwarf for his products, just outside the shop and when he tried to fight the monster, it was already gone and most of the delivered goods were eaten and turned into rust. The four characters started to investigate outside the shop and they noticed tiny footprints heading west and followed it. The footprints lead them to a tavern and it seemed it leads behind it. But Beljahmr saw inside the tavern a human drinking from a large container and everyone was cheering "CHUG! CHUG! CHUG!". It seemed a drinking contest was held and Beljahmr got excited and also cheered for the human from outside. Edward also saw it and cheered for the human as well. While the two were distracted, Kevtumal suddenly disappeared and only Equity was left. After the contest was finished, they noticed that Kevtumal was nowhere to be found.</p>
                <p>
                Equity told them that Kevtumal went ahead and they chat for some minutes. After a while, the three they went after Kevtumal and found a hole, 10 ft. in diameter and 10 f.t deep. They went down carefully and found a dark cave. Equity used dancing lights spell to have light in the area and they all entered. They followed Equity and found Kevtumal, who was already in battle with the rust monster. The three helped Kevtumal and they defeated monster with Equity's rapier slashing it with it's sign "EQ" left on its body, with their weapons and armors rusted by the monster's body. After the battle, the tieflings saw something in the area and grabbed it then went out quickly. Beljahmr was not sure of their intention, but he beheaded the monster for proof of its bounty and went out with Edward.
                When they got out of the cave, they found the tieflings waiting for them. Kevtumal negotiated with them in exchange for the head, they will now give their trust to each other. Beljahmr hesitated at first but Edward agreed with Kevtumal and exchanged with the head.
